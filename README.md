AWS Solutions Architect Associate Exam Prep Notes

I took the test in early 2020 and used the following class from [ACloudGuru to prep for the test.](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WaCAEQfdVlUQHw=/)

Then I used the mock test from [Jon Bonso for practice.](https://www.udemy.com/share/102DhnAEQfdVlUQHw=/)

The course has been updated to reflect new exam material so you should find the latest course based on your need.
Same goes for practice tests.

Here are some notes that I made for quick review of the material.
