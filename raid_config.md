## RAID Configuration Options

### RAID Configuration Options
The following table compares the common RAID 0 and RAID 1 options.

| RAID 0	| RAID 1 |
|-----------|--------|
| used when I/O is more important than fault tolerance; for example, as in a heavily used database | fault tolerance is more important than I/O performance; for example, as in critical application |
| data is written once to any of the available disk	| data is written to/replicated across all disks |
