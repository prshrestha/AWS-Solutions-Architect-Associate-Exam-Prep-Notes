## Fargate and EKS

### What is AWS Fargate?
- For docker images
- AWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that works with both [Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/)
and [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/).
- Fargate removes the need to provision and manage servers, lets you specify and pay for resources per application, and improves security through application isolation by design.

### What is EKS?
- For Kubernetes
- Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a fully managed [Kubernetes service.](https://aws.amazon.com/kubernetes/)
